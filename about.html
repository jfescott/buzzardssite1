	Team Buzzards is a private club which has been around since 1977. We are a group of friends that centers around a common interest in hockey as well as social events and helping our community.
    <br>
    <br>
    We play hockey every Thursday night. We are not a pickup game, nor a league. The people who skate with us, must be members of the club or an invited guest for one night. We do look for new members all the time. However at this point we do have a waiting list of newer people trying to get into the club. We also screen people, meaning we look to ensure new people who want to join are not jerks. Over the years we sadly had several who tried to join who did not work out for that reason. We also do other events, like skiing, going to sports events, have cookouts and a banquet. Members are all expected to pitch in with both their time and money to make all these things happen. Our skating ability ranges from good (not college level good though) to average. Ages of our members range from mid 20's to early 70s. And we don't take ourselves seriously.
